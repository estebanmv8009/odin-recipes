    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Colombian Empanadas are a popular snack or appetizer in Colombia and are served by most Colombian restaurants in the United States with ají sauce.</p>
    <p>Empanadas are popular in Spain and Latin America. Every country has an empanada recipe and even in Colombia we have different versions depending on the region and the cook.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground or Shredded Beef</li>
            <li>Yellow Precooked Cornmeal</li>
            <li>Sazon with Azafran and Salt</li>
            <li>Fresh Cilantro or Parsley</li>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>White Onions</li>
            <li>Scallions</li>
            <li>Tomato</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Red Bell Pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the potatoes in a pot with water and the bouillon tablet for 20-25 minutes or until tender. Drain and gently mash the potatoes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, heavy skillet. Add the onion and cook over medium-low heat stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, green onions, garlic, bell pepper, cilantro, salt and black pepper. Cook for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the ground pork and beef. Cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, for 10 to 15 minutes or until the mixture is fairly dry.</li>
            <li>Transfer the meat mixture to the mashed potatoes bowl and mix well to combine.</li>
            <li>Break small portions of the dough, about 1 ½ tablespoons each one, and form each portion into a ball by rolling between the palms of your hands.</li>
            <li>Place the balls of dough between two pieces of plastic and roll each out very thinly to form a circle. Remove the top plastic and place 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center of each.</li>
            <li>Then using the plastic underneath, fold the dough over to enclose the filling, forming a half circle. Tightly seal the edges by crimping with the tines of a fork.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with vegetable oil and heat over medium heat to 360° F.</li>
            <li>Carefully place 3 or 4 empanadas at the time in the heated oil and fry for about 2 minutes until golden on all sides.</li>
            <li>Using a slotted spoon transfer the empanadas to a plate lined with paper towels. Serve with ají and lime on the side.</li>
        </ol>
