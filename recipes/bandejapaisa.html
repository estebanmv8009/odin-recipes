    <img src="Bandeja-Paisa.jpg" height="310" width="310" alt="Bandeja Paisa Picture">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>It is probably the most popular Colombian dish, originally from the Andean region of the country where the people are called “Paisas” and the area where I was born and raised.</p>
    <p>The Bandeja Paisa includes Colombian style beans, white rice, chicharrón, powdered beef, chorizo, fried egg, ripe plantain, avocado and arepa, but you can substitute the powdered beef for grilled beef.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Colombian Style Beans</li>
            <li>White Rice</li>
            <li>Chicharrón</li>
            <li>Powdered Beef</li>
            <li>Chorizo</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Ripe Plantain</li>
            <li>Avocado</li>
            <li>Arepa</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the beans, hogao and powdered beef one day ahead and keep in the refrigerator</li>
            <li>When you are going to serve the bandeja paisa, heat the beans and powdered beef and hogao. Make the chicharrones</li>
            <li>Cook the white rice and plantains</li>
            <li>Fry the eggs and chorizos</li>
            <li>To serve, place the rice in a tray or platter and place the rest of the ingredients as you like. I prefer the beans in a separate bowl, but you can ladle the beans next to the rice if you like</li>
            <li>Bring the hogao in a serving dish to the table, so people can place it on top of the beans if they like</li>
        </ol>
